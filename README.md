# Deiak Water Network

## Overview
Deiak Water Network is my CS50 final projectâ€”an Android app for mapping and managing water network infrastructure in Corfu, Greece. Users can view nodes (like valves and hydrants) and pipes on a Google Map, while admins can add, edit, or delete them. It connects to a simple Node.js and MongoDB backend.

## Features
- Add, edit, and delete nodes with details like name and status.
- Draw, edit, and delete pipes with flow direction and length.
- Interactive map with zoom, filters, and Corfu bounds.
- Admin-only editing; regular users view only.

## Tech Used
- **Frontend**: Android, Kotlin, Google Maps SDK, Retrofit, Coroutines
- **Backend**: Node.js, MongoDB (separate setup)

## Setup
1. **Clone It**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/DeiakWaterNetwork.git
