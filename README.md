# Deiak Water Network (Android)

## Overview
Deiak Water Network is my CS50 final projectâ€”an Android app for mapping and managing water network infrastructure in Corfu, Greece. It lets users view nodes (e.g., valves, hydrants) and pipes on a Google Map, while admins can add, edit, or delete them. It connects to a Node.js and MongoDB backend (see separate repo).

## Features
- Add, edit, move, and delete nodes with details like name and status.
- Draw, edit, and delete pipes with flow direction and length.
- Interactive map with zoom, filters, and Corfu bounds.
- Admin-only editing; regular users view only.

## Tech Used
- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI**: Android Views (XML)
- **Networking**: Retrofit
- **Concurrency**: Kotlin Coroutines
- **Mapping**: Google Maps SDK
- **Backend**: Node.js + MongoDB (separate repo)

## Setup
1. **Clone It**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NikosKourkoulos1/DEIAK-Android-App.git
   cd DeiakWaterNetwork-Android
